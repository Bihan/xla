## Overview
This repo aims to provide some basic examples of how to run an existing pytorch model with PyTorch/XLA. train_resnet_base.py is a minimal trainer to run ResNet50 with fake data on a single device. Other examples will import the train_resnet_base and demonstrate how to enable different features(distributed training, profiling, dynamo etc) on PyTorch/XLA.The objective of this repository is to offer fundamental examples of executing an existing PyTorch model utilizing PyTorch/XLA. train_resnet_base.py acts as a bare-bones trainer for running ResNet50 with simulated data on an individual device. Additional examples will import train_resnet_base and illustrate how to activate various features (e.g., distributed training, profiling, dynamo) on PyTorch/XLA.
